Unlocking knowledge-sharing live streaming e-commerce: An LLM-empowered analytics framework for book sales prediction
This project contains the raw data, processed result data, and code. It focuses on knowledge-sharing livestream e-commerce, using book-related livestreams as an example. Based on social support theory and large language models (LLMs), it builds a framework for predicting livestream sales. The code is located in the code folder. The social support folder contains the validation set, training set, and fine-tuning dataset for the social support classification task. The product name folder includes the validation and training sets for the product name extraction task. The sale prediction folder contains the raw dataset, the results of the social support classification, the results of the product name extraction, and the constructed dataset of predictive features
